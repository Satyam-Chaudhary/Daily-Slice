## Features

- **Personalized Feeds:** Content is tailored based on user-set preferences.
- **Multi-Source Aggregation:** Fetches data from three distinct sources (NewsAPI, TMDB API, Mock Social API).
- **Tabbed Layout:** Cleanly organizes content by type (All, News, Movies, Social).
- **Infinite Scrolling:** Feeds for news and movies automatically load more content as the user scrolls.
- **Debounced Quick Search:** A highly responsive search bar with a "quick search" dropdown and a dedicated, tabbed results page.
- **Recent Search History:** The search bar remembers and displays recent queries using `localStorage`.
- **Favorites System:** Users can save any piece of content and view it on a dedicated, organized Favorites page.
- **Context-Aware Settings Panel:** A slide-out panel that shows relevant settings for the currently viewed content tab.
- **Dark Mode:** A sleek, modern dark mode with a theme toggle.
- **Responsive Design:** A fully responsive layout that works on all screen sizes.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test coverage including:
    - **Unit Tests** (Jest) for core logic.
    - **Integration Tests** (React Testing Library) for component-Redux interactions.
    - **End-to-End Tests** (Playwright) for critical user journeys.
